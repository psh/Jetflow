/**
 * An animated navigation host that selects UI for every destination and provides necessary
 * components (lifecycles, saved states, view models) through [CompositionLocalProvider]
 * for every unique [NavEntry] in the [controller's][controller] backstack.
 *
 * This composable uses animated transitions to switch between destinations. You may set a custom
 * [AnimatedNavHostTransitionSpec] to specify the desired transitions.
 *
 * If you don't need animated transitions use [NavHost] instead.
 *
 * @param controller a navigation controller that will provide its backstack to this
 * `AnimatedNavHost`. The last entry of the backstack is always the currently displayed entry.
 * You should do all backstack modifications through the same instance of [NavController],
 * but setting a different [NavController] will be handled correctly.
 *
 * @param transitionSpec specifies the desired transitions. If not set, the default transition
 * will be a simple crossfade.
 *
 * @param emptyBackstackPlaceholder an optional placeholder composable that will
 * be displayed when the backstack is empty. In the majority of cases you don't need
 * to set this. Note that the provided composable wouldn't get its own scoped components.
 *
 * @param contentSelector provides a composable that corresponds to the current last destination
 * in the backstack. In other words, here is where you select UI to show (e.g. a screen).
